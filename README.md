Hi! This was the my final project in my Introdustion to Programming/UNIX basics course in the fall of 2021! It is a vending machine simulator. 
The available drinks are read in from a file (machine.txt) and put into an array of structs, each struct being the drink. The structs contain the name,
the amount of cans first available in the machine, and the cost of each drink. The program prints out a "vending machine" for the user to interact with, 
and once the user has decided to conclude the program run, selection sort is applied to sort the drinks based on availibility in the machine when the user
decides to quit the program.
